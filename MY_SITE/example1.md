### What is Git?

Git is an open-source and fast version control system that tracks changes in computer files and handles small to huge software development projects. Git is a top-rated utility for software developers, allowing them to work together without disrupting each other’s work. Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for the Linux kernel.

A snapshot is taken of the complete codebase even when a minor change is made in the code (sometimes it also involves things that are not related to the code). So, developers can now effortlessly review or go back to the previous code versions if required. This is a must-have for enhancing [code quality and coding standards](https://radixweb.com/blog/code-quality-and-coding-standard-in-software-development "code quality and coding standards").

What makes Git stand out from the traditional VCS is that you can swiftly work on varied branch versions of the software product and best manage them simultaneously.

Git is a must-have for development teams who want to perform feature-based development. You can also manually give access to other developers over a LAN.

![GitHub Vs Gitlab](https://d2ms8rpfqc4h24.cloudfront.net/git_distribution_7ab59e0428.jpg)

Git works better than its predecessors like Concurrent Versions System (VCS), Apache Subversion, Rational ClearCase, and Perforce.

The main reason why a lot of VCSs have Git in their name is that you can leverage Git on your own server. For instance, if you want your in-house team to develop a program, you can use a local Git instance. Well! You can also leverage Git as one of the centralized VCS on your own cloud or server.

Git helps you create your own VCS server with no need to subscribe to a VCS service. With Git, you can seamlessly run IT projects with your partners or teams scattered throughout the globe.

Most enterprises opt for cloud-based solutions to ease out working with a remote, larger, or distributed team. For such types of enterprise requirements, GitHub or GitLab offers unlimited storage for code-based repositories. But GitHub and GitLab are cloud-based Git repositories that surpass the basic Git functionalities.

Let’s go beyond the benefit of development team coordination. It’s worth it to probe how your software project can be completely streamlined with a 360-degree collaboration of [DevOps tools](https://radixweb.com/blog/best-devops-tools-for-software-development "DevOps tools"), reliable code repository management, project management, issue tracking, and many other next-gen features. This is made handy through GitHub or GitLab. It also depends on your decisions for [web app vs website](https://radixweb.com/blog/web-app-vs-website "web app vs website").

Ready to delve into the details of a hosted Git service? Explore the two most popular and user-friendly code repository hosting platforms- GitHub and GitLab.

## GitLab vs GitHub: Basics

GitHub was developed by Chris Wanstrath, Scott Chacon, Tom Preston-Werner, and P. J. Hyett using Ruby on Rails (RoR) in February 2008. Taking the first-movers advantage, it became nest to many open-source code repositories.

On the flip side, GitLab was launched later. It was developed by Ukraine developers Valery Sizov and Dmitriy Zaporozhets in 2011. GitHub was smartly designed for a set of project collaboration tools and code repository services.

### What is GitLab vs GitHub?

Let's understand why there has been a raging debate about the GitLab and GitHub difference.

Although both GitLab and GitHub are two of the most popular web-based Git repository hosting services, developers often compare them because they have different approaches to hosting and managing code repositories.
